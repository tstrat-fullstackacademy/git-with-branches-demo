Travis & Josh conquer the world!

Steps for using git with branches and with Team members:

1. Run a `git pull origin main` to make sure you have the lastest code.

2. Switch/Checkout to a new branch for your current task.

3. Write your code
  - add/commit and push often to save the code on git and github

4. When you are satisfied with the current task/feature, be sure to `git push` the final changes to your branch - NOT TO MAIN

5. Made a pull request to merge into main

6. If there are conflicts, git pull origin main and resolve them in VS code.
  - Just edit the file to contain all the things you need.
  - `add/commit/push` again and proceed to merge

7. After Merge - safe to delete branch and switch back to main

8. git pull origin main to get updates locally, and start again
