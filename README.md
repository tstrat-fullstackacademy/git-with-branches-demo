Travis & Josh conquer the world!

Steps for using git with branches and with Team members:

1. Run a `git pull origin main` to make sure you have the lastest code.

2. Switch/Checkout to a new branch for your current task.

3. Write your code
  - add/commit and push often to save the code on git and github

4. When you are satisfied with the current task/feature, be sure to `git push` the final changes to your branch - NOT TO MAIN
